# sqlite3perf

1. `_sync=0&_journal=wal` with `Prepared` reached the max insert speed and good performance for concurrent reads and writes across processes.
1. `db.SetMaxOpenConns(1)` to avoid large WAL Files for concurrent writes.

This repo is originally from [sqlite3perf](https://github.com/mwmahlberg/sqlite3perf) to test sqlite3 performance using [go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)

## Inserts performance among different batch size (prepared mode)

**As the data showed, the `_sync=0&_journal=wal` with `Prepared` reached the max insert speed and good performance for concurrent records and writes among processes.**

[_sync=0 `PRAGMA synchronous = 0 | OFF`](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous):

SQLite continues without syncing as soon as it has handed data off to the operating system.
If the application running SQLite crashes, the data will be safe,
but the database might become corrupted if the operating system crashes or the computer loses power
before that data has been written to the disk surface. On the other hand,
commits can be orders of magnitude faster with synchronous OFF.

[mode=memory SQLITE_OPEN_MEMORY](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/open.html)

The database will be opened as an in-memory database.
The database is named by the "filename" argument for the purposes of cache-sharing,
if shared cache mode is enabled, but the "filename" is otherwise ignored.

[cache=shared SQLite Shared-Cache Mode](https://www.sqlite.org/sharedcache.html)

Starting with version 3.3.0 (2006-01-11), SQLite includes a special "shared-cache" mode (disabled by default)
intended for use in embedded servers. If shared-cache mode is enabled and a thread
establishes multiple connections to the same database, the connections share a single data and schema cache.
This can significantly reduce the quantity of memory and IO required by the system.

## Original blog content

This repository contains a small application which was created while researching a proper
answer to the question [Faster sqlite 3 query in go? I need to process 1million+ rows as fast as possible][so:oq].

The assumption there was that Python is faster with accessing SQLite3 than Go is.

I wanted to check this and hence I wrote a generator for entries into an SQLite database as well as a Go implementation and a Python implementation of a simple access task:

1. Read all rows from table bench, which consists of an ID, a hex encoded 8 byte random value and a hex encoded SHA256 hash of said random values.
2. Create a SHA256 hex encoded checksum from the decoded random value of a row.
3. Compare the stored hash value against the generated one.
4. If they match, continue, otherwise throw an error.

[so:oq]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48000940/

## Introduction

My assumption was that we have a problem with how the performance is measured here, so I wrote a little Go program to generate records and save them into a SQLite database as well as a Python and Go implementation of a little task to do on those records.

You can find the according repository at [mwmahlberg/sqlite3perf](https://github.com/mwmahlberg/sqlite3perf)

### The data model

The records generated consist of

- ID: [A row ID generated by SQLite](https://sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#rowid)
- rand: A hex encoded, 8 byte, pseudo-random value
- hash: A hex encoded, SHA256 hash of the unencoded rand

The table's schema is relatively simple:

```sql
$ sqlite3 sqlite3perf.db
SQLite version 3.28.0 2019-04-15 14:49:49
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE bench (ID int PRIMARY KEY ASC, rand TEXT, hash TEXT);
```

First I generated 1.5M records and vacuumed the sqlite database afterwards with

```bash
üïô[2020-09-02 16:24:53.875] ‚ùØ sqlite3perf generate -r 1500000 -v
2020/09/02 16:25:56  528430/1500000 ( 35.23%) written in 2.000424246s, avg: 3.785¬µs/record, 264161.47 records/s
2020/09/02 16:25:58 1071399/1500000 ( 71.43%) written in 4.000412966s, avg: 3.733¬µs/record, 267822.10 records/s
2020/09/02 16:25:59 1500000/1500000 (100.00%) written in 5.582068414s, avg: 3.721¬µs/record, 268717.60 records/s
2020/09/02 16:25:59 Vaccumating database file
2020/09/02 16:26:01 Vacuumation took 1.588220503s

```

Next I called the Go implementation against those 1.5M records. Both the Go as well as the Python implementation
basically do the same simple task:

1. Read all entries from the database.
1. For each row, decode the random value from hex, then create a SHA256 hex from the result.
1. Compare the generated SHA256 hex string against the one stored in the database
1. If they match, continue, otherwise break.

### Assumptions

My assumption explicitly was that Python did some type of lazy loading and/or possibly even execution of the SQL query.

## The results

### Go implementation

```bash

```

Note the values for "time after query" ( the time the query command took to return)
and the time it took to access the first result set after the iteration over the result set was started.

### Python implementation

```bash
$ python bench.py

```

Again, note the value for "time after query" and the time it took to access the first result set.

## concurrent read and writes

[Parallel read and write in SQLite](https://www.skoumal.com/en/parallel-read-and-write-in-sqlite/)

> Solution is to switch to Write-Ahead Log which works much better for our purposes. 
> To be honest, it is much more better in almost all real-world use-cases. 
> Don‚Äôt hesitate to enable it even if you don‚Äôt need a parallel read and write.

[_journal=wal](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode)

The WAL journaling mode uses a write-ahead log instead of a rollback journal to implement transactions. 
The WAL journaling mode is persistent; after being set it stays in effect across multiple database connections 
and after closing and reopening the database. A database in WAL journaling mode can only be accessed by SQLite version 3.7.0 (2010-07-21) or later.

https://stackoverflow.com/a/25339495/14077979

You can increase the wait time with `PRAGMA busy_timeout` or the corresponding connection parameter, but this does not help if some transaction blocks the database for longer than that.
If you can live with its restrictions, try enabling WAL mode, where a writer does not block readers.

https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/busy_timeout.html

This routine sets a busy handler that sleeps for a specified amount of time when a table is locked. 
The handler will sleep multiple times until at least "ms" milliseconds of sleeping have accumulated. 
After at least "ms" milliseconds of sleeping, the handler returns 0 which causes sqlite3_step() to return SQLITE_BUSY.

```bash
üïô[2020-09-02 16:56:57.644] ‚ùØ sqlite3perf pragma busy_timeout

problems for concurrent reads and writes in WAL mode will cause **Excessively Large WAL Files**

[Avoiding Excessively Large WAL Files](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html)

In normal cases, new content is appended to the WAL file until the WAL file accumulates about 1000 pages (and is thus about 4MB in size) at which point a checkpoint is automatically run and the WAL file is recycled. The checkpoint does not normally truncate the WAL file (unless the journal_size_limit pragma is set). Instead, it merely causes SQLite to start overwriting the WAL file from the beginning. This is done because it is normally faster to overwrite an existing file than to append. When the last connection to a database closes, that connection does one last checkpoint and then deletes the WAL and its associated shared-memory file, to clean up the disk.

So in the vast majority of cases, applications need not worry about the WAL file at all. SQLite will automatically take care of it. But it is possible to get SQLite into a state where the WAL file will grow without bound, causing excess disk space usage and slow queries speeds. The following bullets enumerate some of the ways that this can happen and how to avoid them.

    - Disabling the automatic checkpoint mechanism. In its default configuration, SQLite will checkpoint the WAL file at the conclusion of any transaction when the WAL file is more than 1000 pages long. However, compile-time and run-time options exist that can disable or defer this automatic checkpoint. If an application disables the automatic checkpoint, then there is nothing to prevent the WAL file from growing excessively.
    - Checkpoint starvation. A checkpoint is only able to run to completion, and reset the WAL file, if there are no other database connections using the WAL file. If another connection has a read transaction open, then the checkpoint cannot reset the WAL file because doing so might delete content out from under the reader. The checkpoint will do as much work as it can without upsetting the reader, but it cannot run to completion. The checkpoint will start up again where it left off after the next write transaction. This repeats until some checkpoint is able to complete.
    
        However, if a database has many concurrent overlapping readers and there is always at least one active reader, then no checkpoints will be able to complete and hence the WAL file will grow without bound.
    
        This scenario can be avoided by ensuring that there are "reader gaps": times when no processes are reading from the database and that checkpoints are attempted during those times. In applications with many concurrent readers, one might also consider running manual checkpoints with the SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_RESTART or SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_TRUNCATE option which will ensure that the checkpoint runs to completion before returning. The disadvantage of using SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_RESTART and SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_TRUNCATE is that readers might block while the checkpoint is running.
    
    - Very large write transactions. A checkpoint can only complete when no other transactions are running, which means the WAL file cannot be reset in the middle of a write transaction. So a large change to a large database might result in a large WAL file. The WAL file will be checkpointed once the write transaction completes (assuming there are no other readers blocking it) but in the meantime, the file can grow very big.

As of SQLite version 3.11.0 (2016-02-15), the WAL file for a single transaction should be proportional in size to the transaction itself. Pages that are changed by the transaction should only be written into the WAL file once. However, with older versions of SQLite, the same page might be written into the WAL file multiple times if the transaction grows larger than the page cache.

fix methods:

1. set `db.SetMaxOpenConns(1)` to fix this.
1. `db.Close()` will clear the WAL files.

## Summary

It took the Go implementation quite a while to return after the SELECT query was send, while Python seemed to be blazing fast in comparison. However, from the time it took to actually access the first result set, we can see that the Go implementation is more than 500 times faster to actually access the first result set (5.372329ms vs 2719.312ms) and about double as fast for the task at hand as the Python implementation.

## Notes

- In order to prove the assumption that Python actually does lazy loading on the result set, each and every row and column had to be accessed in order to make sure that Python is forced to actually read the value from the database.
- I chose a hashing task because presumably the implementation of SHA256 is highly optimised in both languages.

## Conclusion

Python does seem to do lazy loading of result sets and possibly does not even execute a query unless the according result set
is actually accessed. In this simulated scenario, mattn's SQLite driver for Go outperforms Python's by between roughly 100%
and orders of magnitude, depending on what you want to do.

Edit: So in order to have a fast processing, implement your task in Go. While it takes longer to send the actual query,
accessing the individual rows of the result set is by far faster. I'd suggest starting out with a small subset of your data,
say 50k records. Then, to further improve your code, use [profiling](https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs)
to identify your bottlenecks.

Depending on what you want to do during processing, [pipelines](https://blog.golang.org/pipelines) for example might help,
but how to improve the processing
speed of the task at hand is difficult to say without actual code or a thorough description.


## sqlite-concurrent-writing-performance

https://stackoverflow.com/a/35805826/14077979

I recently evaluated SQLite3 performance in Go myself for a network application and learned that it needs a bit of setup before it even remotely usable.

Turn on the Write-Ahead Logging

You need to use WAL PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL. That's mainly why you get such a bad performance. 
With WAL I can do 10000 concurent writes without transactions in a matter of seconds. Within transaction it will be lightning fast.

Disable connections pool

I use mattn/go-sqlite3 and it opens a database with SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX flag. 
It means that every SQLite call will be guarded with a lock. Everything will be serialized. 
And that's actually what you want with SQLite. The problem with Go in this situation is that you will get random errors 
that tell you that the database is locked. And the reason why is because of the way the sql/DB works inside. 

Inside it manages pool of connections for you, so it will open multiple SQLite connections 
and you don't want to do that. To solve this I had to, basically, disable the pool. 
Call db.SetMaxOpenConns(1) and it will work. Even on very high loads with tens of 
thousands of concurent reads and writes it works without a problem.

Other solution might be to use SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX to run SQLite in multi-threaded mode and let it manage that for you. 
But SQLite doesn't really work in multi-threaded apps. Reads can happen in parallel but only one write at a time. 
You will get occasional busy errors which are completely normal for SQLite but will require you to do something with them - 
you probably don't want to stop a write operation completely when that happens. 
That's why most of the time people work with SQLite either synchronously or by sending calls to a separate thread just for the SQLite.

creker:

Thanks a lot! With WAL the performance improved to 3.06 seconds; with connection pool closed the performance further improved to 2.65 seconds :) ‚Äì Kyle Mar 4 '16 at 22:23
